Coining my own terms since I can and should.
So let's do it, I am calling it "Native Pixel Display."
This is effectively any 
computer display that is usable without the use of any scaling or other forms of software magnification to be able to read 
the content on the screen.

## This is the historical standard

This is how computer displays have generally worked since the beginning of computing. 
[CRTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode-ray_tube) had some level of resolution changing, but generally speaking, 
there were only a handful of usable resolutions where the display worked best with low flicker, etc. Most CRT displays 
did not require any form of resolution scaling unlike today, what was on the screen was all you could see, and it had 
to be usable as is since that's all there was.

## The size up

After that point, the screens got progressively larger over time and started having larger screen real estate and more 
pixels as well.

Eg I remember staring at resolutions something like the following since 1994:

    280 x 192
    512 x 342 <--- Far past mid to late 1990s era 
    640 x 480 
    800 x 600
    1024 X 768
    1280 X 800
    1440 X 900 
    1920 X 1080
    1900 X 1200
    2560 X 1440
    2560 X 1600  <--- More recent past

## The workspace peak at the 2K size

As a software developer during the past years since working in the software industry since 2008, I have been exposed to 
some of the best computer hardware in the history of the industry. One such thing that I would like to comment on is the 27" to 30" 
2K resolution display. This was the high-end dare I say gold-standard of display standards that started back in 2004 
with the introduction of the Apple Cinema Display 30" and other "nice" displays like the Dell UltraSharp 3007WFP and 
others of similar caliber. These displays featured a 2560 x 1600 max native resolution. Which is still quite good and 
usable as far as a native non-scaled resolution goes on a 27" to 30" computer screen. In fact, this is what I prefer 
using in 2024 granted the 2560 X 1440 variant. This level of resolution, generally speaking, was 
and has been one of the largest pieces of Screen real estate you could buy, since it's been introduced.

## The biggest innovation since 2004 has been adding more pixel density, while maintaining the same or very similar working area

How have we innovated since 2004, we added more pixels density, while maintaining a similar viewing area about the same 
as this old 2K display standard. For example, a modern 4K computer monitor in the 27" to 30" range, must use image 
scaling to scale up the size of everything on the screen otherwise details are too small to be practical if viewed at 
100% or native display scaling. This scaling technology started being called 
[Retina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina_display) displays on Apple stuff and just scaling everywhere else.

Which means in most cases your getting about the same usable workspace, but your GPU is just pushing double the 
pixels, to get higher image quality.
I have not tried this yet other than on my iPhone / iPad where it really makes no 
difference.
I honestly get a better productivity computing experience using my 27" Dell 2k ish monitor,
and no, I am not talking about the price ;).
2K seems good enough for me, but I have yet to try anything higher yet.


## The curveballs they want to sell us on

The super wide curved display, with more horizontal resolution but the about the same vertical height as the old 2K screen and most are stuck on the 1440px height. And widths range from 3440 to 5120. These are innovative in that you can get the resolution of about two 2K displays put 
into one seamless display. But that curve and lack of center bezels comes in at quite a premium price. 

For example, a Dell UltraSharp 49 Curved USB-C Hub Monitor - U4924DW cost $1359.99 as of October 2024. This is a 
5150 x 1440 curved screen, which is the same resolution as buying two 27" monitors like this 
Dell 27 USB-C Monitor - S2722DC at $259.99 each which two of would cost you $519.98 which  means the integration of these
two into a curved slightly small unit cost a whopping $840.00 premium. In this case I will just take the two for cheaper, and have plenty of 
saving to get a nice dual monitor stand. Actually this curved thing is overpriced enough you could buy 4 of the dell 27" screens and still have some left over for a quad monitor stand, and with that 4 monitor setup you would get a legit screen real estate upgrade, just in its clunky lots of wires and stand form. Just an example of how the price for what you get does not make a lot of sense for these curved screens. 

## Alternative reality

These kind of things are not too popular beyond TV sets but 40" - 48" displays. Only a handful of display manufactures make such a beast.
To me these things are the alternative present reality, you get full-size native pixels to use and can enjoy the full 
Quad 1080P experience while using just using one cable. Is that almost what apple promised with the Apple Display 
Connector, well no not really, but still using one cable instead of 4 is impressive to me, in at least three ways.

These are pretty reasonable in price as a purpose-built computer screen at around $700-$1000 USD.

The hack way here is you can buy a decent 4K TV and get the experience for a much lower price, we are talking $300 to $600 price 
range all day long. And TV are usable by more people than used large pro-level monitors, which tend to become closer to 
worthless after you buy one and try to sell its.  

## The future I am looking forward to that's already here in, but its not cheap yet

The 8K TV / Monitor where we get our cake and can eat it too unless they jam all that into a 27" screen then it will be 
a waste... But in a 40"-50" display would be the upgrade I would be waiting for to get larger real estate and better 
image quality too, that would be a real upgrade over this existing workspace area, not just higher image quality in the same working area.

In fact if you're willing to use the TV option, they are available now in the 55" + plus range and can be purchased for around $1500, which is very reasonable especially in the current world of pricey monitors, for example Apple wants $1599 for a 5K Studio Display witch would be about a 2.5K usable workspace in real screen estate.

With this TV you can do quite a lot 8K resolution and you can pick how you wnant to scale it for example 4 3K worth of real estate or push it to the limit at native resolution with four 4K screens, this would only be slightly higher PPI than using a 43" 4K so should be usable at 65".
