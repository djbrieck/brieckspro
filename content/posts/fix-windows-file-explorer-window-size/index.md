For some unknown reason to me, my Windows file explorer window started defaulting to a tiny window size about the size of a four postage stamps square. Here is what I found that worked on Windows 10, to get File Explorer to remember the new window size that I want to start with. 

## The Fix to set your preferred window size for File Explorer

1. Un-maximize or unsnap the window. For me, I have been snapping the window to avoid the resize process by hand each time.

2. Resize the window to about what you want it to be by dragging by the edges with the mouse cursor.

3. Hold down <kbd>CTRL</kbd> key while closing the window, by either clicking the close `X` button with the mouse or selecting `File` dropdown > and then `Close`

4. Re-open a new file explorer window. The window size should now be what you set.
