This is DIY bundle of cords, not making a DIY one to many cord such as the likes of these.

This is a way to keep all the charging cords you need bundled together in your travel bag. This helps me with problem of pulling out one cable and having 3 other random cables coming with it and falling out of the bag pocket and onto floor and possibly getting lost.

Supplies needed

- All the usb cables  you need for travel
- Velcro cables tie/s 1 required, second one optional

1. Gather All the cords you need and do your best to unwrap and untangle them.

2. Position all the cords gathering all the ends that would plug into a usb charger or computer.

3. Tightly gather the ends and install the cable tie around all the ends just gathered.

4. Now all the cords are bundled together by one end , roll  and fold the cords together

5. Place in small pocket in bag or add second cable tie around whole bundle then place in larger compartment as needed or wanted.
