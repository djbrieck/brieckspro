# The present state of compensation

The current state of things can be quite bleak depending on the site visited. But the normal is tons of banner advertisements. Advertisements as content on the site. Advertisements mix into the content you are reading, sometimes done so badly that it causes you to loose place on what your reading. Advertisements hidden in the text so that a hover shows while reading. To the worse case where adds cover the content, play videos, and do many more things including invading your privacy. Many times these advertisement consume extra resources causing fans to turn on and inevitable waste time and power. Also many times while trying to get past the ads one ends up clicking on something unintendedly and end up off the site your started at, and probably forgetting the whole point of the original visit to the site. In my opinion this is just terrible, and not how we should be running things. So as consumers and producers of internet content we should do something different.

# Nothing is free on the internet

This is something that we really need to address and understand, for everything on the internet there is a cost that someone has to pay to keep that content up and available. The idea that everything is free and no one ever has to pay is in my opinion the route of the current problems of todays internet advertising model. 

- there is a cost to get and keep a domain
- there is a cost to keep hosting going, to make the content available.  

## Future of Internet value for value ? 

I think the future of the internet should work more along the lines with what is being tried with Podcasting 2.0. Where one utilizes an automated accounting system that can provide payment to the content creator as the consumer use the website, with out the user being required to go through a payment action list requiring active effort like would be needed for a credit card payment or using some other system like PayPal, CashApp, Patreon etc to make a one time or recurring payment to support the content being absorbed. This kind of system provided a more realistic  so that when your spending time on a site your contributing a bare minimum amount that the consumer agrees to pay for the value they receive from their browsing effort, which could be zero. Using the same system more purposeful one time bonus payments or boosts would also be allowed, and would be truly one click payments. With this system its completely up to the consumer of the content to place and contribute value to the content producer. Sure this is a scarry system, but with a little faith something like this could solve the problems of the internet.

# Solutions that are pressing forward with something thats hopefully better than the old normal

## Brave Basic Attention Token

Value for value for the web, well almost. The [Brave Rewards](https://brave.com/brave-rewards/) program is a very interesting concept. I am going to specifically references the implementations of Tipping and Auto Contribute. 

# Tipping with Brave rewards
However the centralization and from just one organization is a potential problem.

# major down side is its centralized and managed by Brave
