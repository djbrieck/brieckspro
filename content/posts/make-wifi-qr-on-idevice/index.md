Learned something new you can connect to Wi-Fi using a QR code, this QR code is easily accessible in Android for sharing from the Wi-Fi Settings, but a bit of a challenge on iPhone / iPad, but can  be accomplished just the same.

The good news is that this work cross-platform its rather easy to get a Wi-Fi share QR created. And I was able to observe it working from Android to iPad. So my questions was can I generate a QR from that iPhone or iPad to be able to share to someone else.

And the answer is yes you can, but making the QR it's a many step kind of drawn out and overcomplicated process.

To complete this you will need the [Apple Shortcuts](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shortcuts/id915249334) app installed.

1. Open the Shortcuts App

2.  Find and touch the "Gallery" icon

3. Find and touch the Shortcuts for Accessibility

4. Look through the Access Tools and find the "QR Your Wi-Fi" shortcut.

5. Then touch the "+ Add Shortcut" button

6. Tap the shortcuts button at the bottom, then tap "All Shortcuts" at the top.

7. Tap "QR your Wi-Fi"

8. Enter Wi-Fi name it should show by default the one you are connected to.

9. Enter the Wi-Fi password carefully you must get this right otherwise the QR will not work. Unfortunately, Apple will 
not automatically fill this in based the password its using to connect.

10. QR code is generated and displayed on the screen.

11. Tap the QR code and share or save the code as needed to be able to reuse.
