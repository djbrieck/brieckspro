My Cowboy coffee implementation 


## Equipment used:

- heat source

- small sauce pan & lid, use larger if more people want coffee now, small pan is good for 1-2 cups

- mug/s

- after brew filter (optional)

- Ground coffee 

- spoon

## How to make Cowboy Coffee 

1. Fill clean mug/s with water 

2. Pour mug/s into clean sauce pan, get larger pot as needed

3. Bring water to boil

4. Once water boils turn off / remove from heat source, let stand for 1 minute.

5. Dump your measured coffee into sauce pan 1-2 spoons per cup is a starting point, this is for "weak" coffee, they way I like it.

6. Put the lid on the sauce pan, let it brew for 4 mins, no need to stir.

7. Remove lid and let it sit for 1 mins to cool.

8. Add pour over / through filter to top of mug. (Optional )
If not using filter add some cool water to top of pan to help settle grounds, using the spoon, etc

9. Slowly pour coffee into mug/s.

10. Prepare and enjoy your coffee as you like, its ready to drink and not too hot too.
