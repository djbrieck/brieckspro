Since moving from Memphis, Tennessee, to the northwester part of the country. I have noticed there are almost no BBQ 
places out here. In the Memphis Area, you had probably four or more different BBQ places basically all around on every 
corner. All were pretty decent too, really was no such thing as BAD BBQ out in Memphis, even the worst was leaps and 
bounds better than fast food garbage.

While on a trip to downtown Boise ID. I located a BBQ place called [R and R BBQ](https://randrbbq.com/) at `150 N 8th St.` 
Have to say it was fantastic. I got their `Pineapple Pulled pork sandwich with fries`. It was just what I was looking 
for. This downtown location was very nice, and the food was well-prepared, hot and ready to eat. I am impressed with 
this chain reminds me a lot of my favorite local chain from Memphis [Baby Jacks](https://www.babyjacks.com/)

They also have a range of sauces at the table: Original, Hot, Sweet, Carolina, something I have not seen since Memphis 
for sure.

Impressed with this place, so if you find your self in Utah or Idaho or anywhere, R and R BBQ has a location I highly 
recommend them, so far it's the best that I have tried this west of Memphis.
