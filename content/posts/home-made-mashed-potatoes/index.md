It's very refreshing to not have a overcomplicated recipe for making mashed potatoes, like every other recipe I found on the internet. So I am quoting and preserving this one since this needs to be saved and shared:

## The Process Extracted

1. Brush / Clean off potatoes

2. Get a weight on how many potatoes you want to cook

3. Peel or don't peel

4. Slice potatoes evenly

5. Boil Potatoes gently until sharp knife can pass through potatoes with no resistance.

6. Mash the potatoes a little using a potato masher.

7. Mix in 1/2 stick of butter for each pound of potatoes prepared.

8. Allow a few minutes for the butter to melt

9. Add a splash of heavy cream

10. Add a pinch of salt

11. Mix it all together using the masher

12. Taste "If it doesn't taste super rich and nicely salted, add more butter, cream, and salt until it tastes like Thanksgiving."


## The original source
"twelve different spices

Good mashed potatoes don't need any spices. Good mashed potatoes are mostly butter, heavy cream, and salt (in that order). Good mashed potatoes are not healthy. You don't even need a recipe for good mashed potatoes. You just gently boil potatoes (peeled or unpeeled, doesn't really matter) until a sharp knife passes through them with no resistance. Pro tip: it's easier to cut a potato into even discs, rather than an even dice. Even pieces mean it will all cook at the same rate.

Now, assuming you have a potato masher, mash briefly, then mix in like 1/2 stick of butter for each pound of potatoes you started with (4 tablespoons of butter per pound of potatoes). Give it a chance to melt. Now add some heavy cream. Just eyeball it, but not too much because you don't want it too wet. Add a big pinch of salt, mix it in. Now taste everything. If it doesn't taste super rich and nicely salted, add more butter, cream, and salt until it tastes like Thanksgiving."
