If your running Linux on your computer you may surprisingly notice that it sometimes may not show the captive portal on controlled free Wi-Fi access in places like a hotel. For some reason or another the captive portal may fail to show.  Here is what I did to get it working since getting technical support for Linux of Hotel Wi-Fi is going to be near non-existent. Linux  Mint 21.x is what I was using.

1. Connect to the official hotel Wi-Fi access points, figure out what the name of the official hotel Wi-Fi before connecting.

2. Open a browser and try to load something, if that fails or does nothing continue on  or redirect to the hotels page asking for an acknowledgement or pin or room number, etc. 

3. Open Network Settings

4. Click the ring settings gear next to the wireless network you are attempting to connect to.

5. Find the default route IP, and copy it

6. Paste it in the URL bar of your browser and press enter.

7. When the page loads review and agree to any terms and conditions and then hotel internet should  work.
