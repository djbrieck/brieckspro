If your running Linux on your computer you may suprisingly notice that it sometimes may not show the captive portal on controlled free Wifi access in places like a hotel. For some reason or another the captive portal may fail to show.  Here is what I did to get it working since getting techical support for Linux of Hotel wifi is going to be near non existant. Linux  Mint 21.x is what I was using.

1. Connect to the offical hotel WiFi access points, figure out what the name of the offical hotel Wifi before connecting.

2. Open a browser and try to load something, if that fails or does nothing continue on  or redirect to the hotels page asking for an ackonledge ment or pin or room number, etc then do go onto the next step.

3. Open Network Settings

4. Click the ring settings gear next to the wireless network you are attempting to connect to.

5. Find the default route IP, and copy it

6. Paste it in the URL bar of your browser and press enter.

7. When the page loads review and agree to any terms and conditions and then hotel internet should  work.
