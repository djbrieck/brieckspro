## The Problem

Your running Linux Mint or other Linux on a Classic Mac Pro {1,1; 2,1;  3,1; 4,1 or 5,1} you may have noticed that 
opening the DVD / optical drive is a bit of a challenge under Linux on these macs or other similar systems. The old 
macOS tricks of pressing and holding F12 key no longer works. And there appears to be no applets or shortcuts available 
yet on the panel to send a command to open the drive. And since its Mac, there's no physical button on the front of 
the computer to press. So how can you open the optical disk tray when there is no physical button when running Linux 
Mint? And you don't want to restart the Mac while holding down the left mouse button.

## Solution one using the Disks program

Here is the workaround that I found using already included software in Linux Mint.

1.  Open menu and search for "disk"

2. Open the Disks program.

3. Select the CD / Optical drive listed on the left that you want to open.

4. Click the "Eject this disk" icon

5. Drive should pop open on the computer.

6. Load the Optical disk

7. Push in the CD tray to close

## Solution 2 using the Nemo File Manager

Another Work Around using the Nemo file organizer or what we may call My Computer option on legacy Microsoft Windows.

Search for "files"

Open "Files" program.

Click the  menu option "Go" > Computer

Find the icon/s that look like a optical disk / CD / DVD for the drive you want to open.

Right click the icon and then select the "Eject" option.

Place the disc and push the tray closed to start the loading process
