## Experiments  

### The single serving attempt
Tried a brief experiment using my standard  mug (12-14oz) filled with water and one scope or about 2 teaspoons of coffee in the instant pot (pressure cooker). A single serving just to see how well this does compare to how I usually make a single serving of coffee which is using the drip paper filtered [Cowboy coffee]({{< ref "posts/cowboy-coffee">}})


## Single serving (not recommended takes a long time for just one cup)

1. Set up instant pot lid and using the stainless steel inset pan

2. Dump one drinking mug full of coffee into a stainless steel inner cooking pot.
3. And one plastic scoop of coffee (about 2 teaspoons) adjust up or down from there...
4. Put on the lid and make sure all the vents closed in sealing position for pressure-cooking.
5. Start pressure-cooker mode on high pressure with a 4-minute timer.
6. Wait for natural release may take around 30 minutes. 
7. Open PC 
8. Carefully remove the inner cooking pot using a grippe oven / silicon mit 
8. Pour coffee thought a filter to filter out the grounds using a paper filter, these grounds will be ultra fine and may cause the filter to plug up.

The results were unexpectedly good, to me the coffee seemed to have extra strength and a better flavor,
almost so that I could have probably used just half the grounds that I normally do. Also I found the flavor to be somewhere in between cold brew and drip, I need to do more tests with coffee tasting experts.


## Making a full liter of coffee or about 2.5 mugs worth 

Next experiment 1 liter thermos with 2 scopes of grounds or about (4 teaspoons)

Natural release took 46 - 53 minutes

Need to check the output temperature hopefully its at least 160 degrees farenheight. Was around 173 after the natural release.

After the natural release I ran the results though the coffee stand filter right into the mug / insulated thermos for  storage.

Was very strong in flavor using same amounts as done in my improved cowboy process.
