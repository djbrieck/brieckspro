## Summary 

A consise and practical guide to doing the Git Feature Branch Workflow, for more details and source documentation see [Git Feature Branch Workflow by Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow)

In short each change, story , feature, or defect gets its own branch, and that branch will get merged via a pull request back into `main` when its ready.

# Getting started the Checkout

Feel free to replace `main` with `master` as needed depending on how your repo is configured.

    git checkout main
    git pull origin
    git reset --hard origin/main --Optional but if you want to follow the approach with a clean slate use this

# Creating the branch

# Makeing changes

# Keeping your branch up to date 

# pushing your changes back to the repo

# opening the pull request

# Aprove or reject the changes

# Merge the changes 

# Delete the branch
