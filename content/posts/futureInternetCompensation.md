# The present state of compensation

The current state of things can be quite bleak depending on the site visited. But the normal is tons of banner advertisements. Advertisements as content on the site. Advertisements mix into the content you are reading, sometimes done so badly that it causes you to loose place on what your reading. Advertisements hidden in the text so that a hover shows while reading. To the worse case where adds cover the content, play videos, and do many more things including invading your privacy. Many times these advertisement consume extra resources causing fans to turn on and inevitable waste time and power. Also many times while trying to get past the ads one ends up clicking on something unintendedly and end up off the site your started at, and probably forgetting the whole point of the original visit to the site. In my opinion this is just terrible, and not how we should be running things. So as consumers and producers of internet content we should do something different.

# Nothing is free on the internet

This is something that we really need to address and understand, for everything on the internet there is a cost that someone has to pay to keep that content up and available. The idea that everything is free and no one ever has to pay is in my opinion the route of the current problems of todays internet advertising model. 

- there is a cost to get and keep a domain
- there is a cost to keep hosting going, to make the content available.
- there is a cost to maintain and make the content

## Future of Internet value for value ? 

I think the future of the internet should work more along the lines with what is being tried with Podcasting 2.0. Where one utilizes an automated accounting system that can provide payment to the content creator as the consumer use the website, with out the user being required to go through a payment action list requiring active effort like would be needed for a credit card payment or using some other system like PayPal, CashApp, Patreon etc to make a one time or recurring payment to support the content being absorbed. This kind of system provided a more realistic  so that when your spending time on a site your contributing a bare minimum amount that the consumer agrees to pay for the value they receive from their browsing effort, which could be zero. Using the same system more purposeful one time bonus payments or boosts would also be allowed, and would be truly one click payments. With this system its completely up to the consumer of the content to place and contribute value to the content producer. Sure this is a scarry system, but with a little faith something like this could solve the problems of the internet.

# Solutions that are pressing forward with something thats different but is it better

## Brave Basic Attention Token

Value for value for the web, well almost. The [Brave Rewards](https://brave.com/brave-rewards/) program is a very interesting concept. I am going to specifically references the implementations of Tipping and Auto Contribute, since the earning money or credits from looking at advertisements is really not the way I want things to go. The attention grabbing notifications on Brave had to be turned off...

# Tipping with Brave rewards
This really make a lot of sense, and allows you to set up  a one time tip or set up a recurring monthly tip of your choosing. Downside is that there is a 0.25 BAT minimum tip. 

One downside is that the system preserves anonymity, which may be good for privacy, but the creator has no idea who sent the money. And is potentially another way to disconnect creators from their customers, kind of following the App Store model of Apple and Google, where all you get is your cut of payment and access to view comments / reviews of your app, no access to your list of customers.


# Auto Contribution with Brave rewards
 
This does not make a lot of sense to me, appears with this system you pick how much you want to spend monthly, and then brave decides how to divy that out to the supported sites, based on how they determine attention on each site. This seems very much like the old Netflix model but maybe with a little more transparency, in that you can see where your money was spent. 


# its a pain to get started if you want to contribute your own money

If you done want to rely on just what your getting from brave ads, your out. You need to set up a custodial wallet, and you have have just 2 choices. And yes you have to save up to get enough coin to be able to set up real wallet.

Uphold and Gemini wallets

Uphold seems like the better choice with no fees unless you are converting to another currency. However you have to wait around until you get 2 BAT in your Brave wallet via ads, which is just silly. I have money I want to spend and your saying no I can't put money in your wallet, until I use the browser enough to earn 2 BAT. Just a bit of a hassle, whats the point of making this difficult is my question? This seems wrong...

Trying to use this has turned into a chore from the users side, and thats not good. Currently my situation is wait for my wallet to get large enough for me to verify it, to be able to contribute real money.



# major down side is Brave rewards are centralized managed and exclusive to Brave browser

Brave is managing the list of of verified content creators. Its centralized and there is lots of legal stuff to sign up and agree to terms and such in order to participate in the program, so "Don't piss me off, Art!" or your out.

Also it only works in the Brave browsers, and while thats fantastic for Brave. Brave is just one browser, and I don't know about you, but I change browsers over time, and getting locked into one browser sounds like a bad deal, no matter how much good is promised to creators.

# Again, The solution is value for value with something that does the following in a open way.

- Allows the Users to add value quick and easy in order to contribute directly, and is not dependent on advertising to generate all the life blood of the ecosystem getting started.

- Anyone that adopts this new protocol can start receiving value with a valid wallet, etc, there is no approval process and no centralized place to ask for permission. You adopt protocol on your website and can start receiving value from users that are willing.

- Same is true for the user, you get full control of the wallet immediately.

- Can work on any browser via a plug in, etc.

- User has complete control over how much value they want to contribute and full control over how the process can work automatically on the users behalf.
