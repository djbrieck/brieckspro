## Introduction 
When your first getting started with believe in God some want to have a miracle that can be seen that proves that God exists. This specific example is mentioned in the bible, and if you seek this nothing will be provided as proof for you. As noted in the bible in  [Mathew 12:39 But He answered and said to them, “An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah.](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=mathew%2012%3A39&version=NKJV)

## A miracle for me and a start to change how I pray

I was in a low state at work and need help as I was at my limit and stuck for weeks on a problem. I took my problem to God. I prayed about it and the next day.  
It all came together and was resolved. 

That was really proof for me that God exists and listened to me and helped me solve my problems. And in turn I am giving God all the credit for this one.

In the past I relegated prayer to something done once a day at bedtime. Saying to myself or out loud the [Matthew 6:5-13 - Lord's model Prayer](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%206%3A5-13&version=NKJV). Here is the version below that I have memorized.

    Our father who art in heaven
    hallowed be thy name.
    thy kingdom come,
    thy will be done on earth as its done in heaven.
    Give us this day or daily bread.
    Foregive us our trespassors, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
    LEad us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
    For thine is the kingdom, the power. and the glory forever.
    Amen.

Now I provide God the more exact words of the problems I am facing. And following the model to fill in the rest. But there is real value in talking things out with God, and being open to receive influence back and taking the opportunity to allow yourself that space and time. This may be a potential origin of the scarceness of praying to God. But with the limitless potential of God why should we severally limit our time and important communications. So to me this means talk about the most important things and don't act like your putting an entertainment show suitable for a large audience.

Just the same you need to pray and keep that faith in God no matter how you do it, doing it is the important part. Don't let any limits discourage you.
