My Cowboy coffee implementation 


## Equipment used:

- heat source

- small sauce pan & lid, use larger if more people want coffee now, small pan is good for 1–2 cups

- mug/s

- after brew filter (optional)

- Ground coffee 

- spoon

## How to make Cowboy Coffee 

1. Fill clean mug/s with water 

2. Pour mug/s into clean sauce pan, get larger pot as needed

3. Bring water to boil

4. Once water boils, turn off / remove from the heat source, let stand for 1 minute.

5. Dump your measured coffee into sauce pan 1–2 spoons per cup is a starting point, this is for "weak" coffee, they way I like it.

6. Put the lid on the sauce pan, let it brew for four minutes, no need to stir.

7. Remove the lid and let it sit for one minute to cool.

8. Add pour over / through filter to the top of the mug.
   (Optional)
If not using a filter, add some cool water to the top of the pan to help settle grounds, using a spoon, etc.

9. Slowly pour coffee into mug/s.

10. Prepare and enjoy your coffee as you like, It's ready to drink and not too hot.
