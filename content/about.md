###  Paid Editing $
 I don't have an editor and as a technical developer, grammar and writing is not my strong suite. If you see a problem and would like to help me fix it. Please see the [editing how to](/posts/how-to-edit-this-site/). I will pay a dollar (USD) per accepted fix. Payments will be made via Bitcoin Lightning network, [Strike](https://strike.me) is a good solution to get started but any Bitcoin lightning wallet will work.
