Found a good way to test that your phones call audio headset, etc. is working properly. Really nicely done system up over at [The Test Call](http://thetestcall.blogspot.com/?m=0) and automated system that will allow you to record and playback yourself to ensure that you are sounding great.

No more bothering friends and family to test random hardware is working, now you call them after your sure its working.

## Simply find and dial one of these numbers depending on where you are:

On The Test Call page find the section [PSTN numbers](http://thetestcall.blogspot.com/?m=0) and dial the one closet to your local area.
