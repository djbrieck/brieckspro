I put this thing together way back in the 2010 time frame as an alternative to using the cheap Mr. Coffee makers, that would fail after just a few months to years of full time office use.

The goal was a pour over system that was more hands off. So I put this thing together using a laboratory stand, BUNN Coffee filter basket,  2 ring supports and one commercial cooking inset pan used to keep food warm in a cafeteria / food service situation.

I drilled a whole in the bottom of the inset pan and slapped it all together looking something like this.

While this worked, it had some downsides, random water flow when first starting, causing hot water to at first out and miss the filter basket for about a splash of water
