[The Local](https://www.localcoffeecream.com/) is a local spot for coffee, ice cream, and light breakfast or lunch options.

The main two entrance doors are on Adams and Greenwood St. which leads you into the coffee and ice cream counter. Note that there is no on-site parking lot, only a drive-through and street parking.

In the back, past the ice cream freezers, is a separate counter for ordering breakfast and lunch.

The food is good. I tried the all-day breakfast sandwich, which came with chips. It was pricey at $13.50 in May 2025.

Drip coffee is decent but served too hot. After cooling, the flavor was enjoyable.

The ice cream is better than soft serve but not as good as [Tillamook Extra Creamy](https://www.tillamook.com/products/ice-cream/all). At $4.50 per scoop, it’s expensive but better than fast-food desserts.

Seating is limited and mostly uncomfortable, with hard chairs, benches, and stools. There are only a few padded chairs and a small couch. This setup discourages lingering, which contrasts with the name and backstory suggesting a hangout for locals, unfortunately.

Overall, it’s a great place for coffee, ice cream, or a light meal. The service is fast and friendly.
