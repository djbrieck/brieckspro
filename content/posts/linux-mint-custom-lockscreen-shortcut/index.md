`Melange - Cinnamon Debugger`.

This is a guide on how to remap screen lock shortcut so that it's <kbd>Win/Super</kbd> + <kbd>L</kbd> instead of 
Linux Mint default of <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>ALT</kbd> + <kbd>L</kbd> to lock the screen.

Relevant for Debian, Linux Mint and possibly more Cinnamon-based UI Linux distributions.

6. Press the keys <kbd>super</kbd> + <kbd>L</kbd>
