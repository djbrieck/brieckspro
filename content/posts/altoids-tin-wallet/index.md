# Introduction
While I was at the Apple Store in boise town center getting a new battery installed.  I saw something truly innovative by another customer also in for a genius bar appointment.

The gentleman had an old well-worn Altoids tin that he had pulled from a pocket to pay for service at the Apple Store. I noticed and asked about it.  He said he had been using the tin for over 10 years. I never had a traditional leather wallet last 10 years. And I was needing a new wallet, and had a tin in my backpack still with mints in it. So I gave it a try moving to this new wallet on July 22, 2024.

# Altoids Tin makes a pretty good Wallet

The tin is just the right size for a wallet. It is a bit larger than a credit card, so it can hold quite a few cards and some cash. I have been using it for a few months now, and it is working out well. I have my ID, credit cards, and a few other cards in it. I have also been able to keep some cash in it as well.

# Managing the wallet

I use bubble to the top management technique for my wallet. I have a few cards that I use all the time, and I keep them at the top of the stack. I have a few cards that I use less often, and I keep them in the middle of the stack. I have a few cards that I use rarely, and I keep them at the bottom of the stack. I have a few cards that I use only in emergencies, and I keep them in the back of the stack. This is the best way to manage the wallet since getting the card out can be a bit of a hassle.
