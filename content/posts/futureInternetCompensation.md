# The present state of compensation

The current state of things can be quite bleak depending on the site visited. But the normal is tons of banner advertisements. Advertisements as content on the site. Advertisements mix into the content you are reading, sometimes done so badly that it causes you to loose place on what your reading. Advertisements hidden in the text so that a hover shows while reading. To the worse case where adds cover the content, play videos, and do many more things including invading your privacy. Many times these advertisement consume extra resources causing fans to turn on and inevitable waste time and power. Also many times while trying to get past the ads one ends up clicking on something unintendedly and end up off the site your started at, and probably forgetting the whole point of the original visit to the site. In my opinion this is just terrible, and not how we should be running things. So as consumers and producers of internet content we should do something different.  

## Future of Internet value for value ? 

I think the future of the internet should work more along the lines with what is being tried with Podcasting 2.0. Where one utilizes an automated accounting system that can provide payment for the user as they use the website, with out the user being required to go through a payment action list requiring active effort like would be needed for a credit card payment or using some other system like PayPal, CashApp, etc to make a one time or reccuring payment to manually support the content being produced. This kind of system provided a more realistic  so that when your spending time on a site your contributing a bare minimum amount that the user agrees to pay for the value they receive from their browsing effort, which could be zero. Using the same system more purposeful one time bonus payments or boosts would also be allowed, and would be truly one click payments. With this system its completely up to the consumer of the content to place and contribute value to the content producer. Sure this is a scarry system, but with a little faith something like this could solve the problems of the internet.

Value for value for the web, well almost. The [Brave Rewards](https://brave.com/brave-rewards/) program is a very interesting concept. I am going to specifically references the implementations of Tipping and Auto Contribute.
