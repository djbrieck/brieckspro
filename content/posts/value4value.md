## What is Value 4 Value

 Value for Value `=`Is a model of voluntarily letting the consumer of content contribute value for the content, based on the value received from the content.

 This value can vary from person to person, and is up to each person to decide what to pay or to not pay. This works really well in the digital world, and maybe could work in the physical world too, however that is a whole different discussion.

## No Agenda Show

This concept of value for value has been coined and put into practice by [John C. Dvorak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_C._Dvorak) and [Adam Curry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Curry) on [The No Agenda Show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Agenda)

I think their [Support & Donation page](http://dvorak.org/na/) says it best.

- Value for Value 

- Next level is titles based on how much is paid. 

For now I want to focus on value for value part, here are some examples from the No Agenda Donation page.

>Unlike any other broadcasts, No Agenda has decided to be a solely listener supported production. This means the listeners contribute to the show both financially and through volunteerism. If you feel you are getting value from this show, please help us by becoming a supporter and passing the word that No Agenda is THE BEST PODCAST IN THE UNIVERSE.
>
>We count on you, to make this work.

> Dollar an Hour is All We Ask.
>
>This is our value for value offering. One dollar for an hour of solid and real information you can use. Plus entertainment more valuable than any movie.

And this model has been working since 2007 for No Agenda.
