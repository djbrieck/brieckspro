Wanted a nicer travel case for a [Keyboardio Atreus keyboard](https://shop.keyboard.io/products/keyboardio-atreus), did 
not want to spend [$30 on a soft nylon bag style case from the Keyboardio store](https://shop.keyboard.io/products/keyboardio-atreus-travel-case?variant=44336384246051), esp since I only paid $50 for the keyboard itself.

So I found on reddit that some people have been using stethoscope cases as keyboard cases, and yes it works perfectly. https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/5zsjc0/found_the_perfect_travel_case_for_my_atreus/

I found and purchased on used on eBay for $10 including shipping.
