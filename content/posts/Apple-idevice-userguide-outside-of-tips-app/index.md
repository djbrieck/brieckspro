If your running a Apple iPhone or iPad  I highly recommend taking a look at the  corresponding User Guide for the operating system its running. I honestly have never really looked closely at this since picking up a iPhone, since mostly it just works good enough without having to read the manual.  Its usually found in the [Apple Tips](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tips/id1069509450) on your iPhone / iPad but you can also view it on any computer with a modern web browser by visiting the following:
