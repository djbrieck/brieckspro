## Backstory

I was looking for a newer computer to replace my Aging Mac Pro 3,1. I was running into several issues that made it clear it was time to move off of this computer as my full time computer.

- The loud fan issue with the open source GPU driver support for my ATI Radeon HD 5770 GPU . Everything worked well enough it was just that  the GPU fan was out of control when running any kind of current Linux version, with constant cycling sound as the fan changed RPMs.  AMD had dropper driver support and only opensource drivers are available for the HD 5770. I was on Linux Mint 21.x at the time. 

- High power consumption was a bit out of hand as well, at nearly 300 watts idle for the entire Mac Pro, which is about what our space heater draws on low power, and for a system that's on 24/7 it was a bit much and with an east facing window as well.

- Ram was lacking too I had 16GB and a couple of modules had failed leaving with me only 12GB of ram. And RAM since it requires ECC and special heat sinks is not cheap for this system.

- Limited GPU upgrade support if I want to see a boot screen, which I do want, LOL. Also, my best upgrade option for my use case is an Nvidia Quadro K5000 Mac Edition or  Mac EFI flashed PC card. Such a hassle and trying to maintain compatibility with MAc Os 10.11 as installed as well is a goal of mine with this system. Since I have no interest installing with installing a newer macOS  on it. Also since it seems like no one is running this card on this Mac with a modern linux I have no guarantee if it will work any better than the HD 5770 on linux. 

## Finding a better solution

I started looking for something else and started looking at used computer systems  for sale on [eBay](https://www.ebay.com). Looking at old Dell, HP, Lenovo workstations, CPU Mother board Combos and custom PC.  And I managed to spot this one for sale under a brand of  [Velocity Micro](https://velocitymicro.com/). Had no idea  about Velocity Micro. I did catch the case, which looked very much like a Lian Li Pc case of yore that I always wanted to try. So after reviewing the Specs it was quite a deal and even a decent upgrade over the current 2008 Mac Pro 3,1.  

The selling points for me:

- Nice Lian Li like case with room for many drives including optical  5.25 bays, classic.

- Asus Z-87 Deluxe Motherboard with tons of Sata ports and plenty of PCIE slots.

- And a former high-end [Intel i7 4770K As you can see quite a nice upgrade over the Dual Xeon E5462 Mac Pro](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/compare/1919vs1237.2/Intel-i7-4770K-vs-Intel-Xeon-E5462)

- The whole thing was a bundle deal and was around $123 not including shipping.

After receiving the system I was able to confirm the Case was manufactured by Lian Li so this is a real deal high quality aluminum case.

- Also as added bonus the system came with a high-end LG Blu-ray reading / burner drive installed. 

- Very impressed with Velocity Micro, the system used quality parts and was well put together, and they still helped me get the parts I needed on something over 11 years old.

## Fixes needed to get started using this as my primary system

-  No Hard drive mounting brackets / screws
- No GPU
- Creaky Blue LED fans


As it was received I was a bit short on a few things, no GPU but it does have integrated GPU, so that was enough to get the thing running . The other  issues was hard drives, this cases requires something special to mount the 3.5" disk drives, it did not have the needed parts. I need to be able to move over the four drives from the Mac Pro and not have then laying loose in the case. Luckily this was a Velocity Miro build and I was able to contact support and they mailed me out a parts bag for like $20

The GPU part I solved with Facebook market place, I found a whole computer with a Nvidia GTX 1050 Ti GPU for $100, which at the time was what the GPU itself was worth so I picked it up and some more problems with it, another case althouhg this one was a missing side door and GPU with a missing mounting bracket. But all things considered got a whole another with GPU, HDD etc for the $100 so was not a bad deal for the time frame.

The case fans had to go, they were the original Lian Li that came with case.  In fact they were so old that they did not even support PWM like the motherboard in the system did. I am guessing this system was upgraded by Velocity Micro to the Z-87 board. Anyways the fans had a lot of bearing creaking noise a sound similar to crickets chirping but at a lower pitch. Found some Noctua fans used on eBay. I bought the quite server fans, which replaced the chirping with the quiet roar of airflow. At some point I may try to find something more quiet but for now these work well enough, I would like a little more quiet, like the Mac Pro was sans the GPU which on its on rivals the entire roar of the Velmo system.


## Other changes made

- removed the blue Logo lighting board
- Added intake filter mesh

Lastly I had to remove the front logo LED board. It was just too blue  and bright especially at night, I know the blue LED was a marvelous innovation of the 2000s era, but I have never been a fan, I am still old school and prefer the green LED everywhere.

## Future changes

- RGB Fan for the lower intake to add some custom LED lighting effects and at some light back to the front case in a more controllable manner

- Upgrade the CPU cooler , since the stock intel one can sound a bit like a steam train whistle off far in the distance. Would like to have a chonker block of noctua dh-14 etc if it will fit in the case.

- Upgrade to a newer Motherboard, a NVME upgrade would be a huge improvement since my current workflows if trying to do too much at once easily swamps the sata SSDs I have.

- Upgrade the GPU
