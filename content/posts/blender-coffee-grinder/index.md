Yes, using a blender to grind coffee works reasonably well.
I have been doing this for over 3 years.
Here is what I have been doing that is working for me.

Itâ€™s not the most consistent way to ~~blend ~~ grind coffee beans, but it works and is about the same as a cheap coffee grinder and this thing does not smell like It's burning up, for now I have no need to buy another better grinder this is good enough for my daily cup of coffee, and I find another use for an appliance I already have.  

## Stuff needed:

- Blender
- roasted un-ground coffee beans
- 1 cup measuring cup
- Wooden skewer or equivalent stick
- Container/s to store the ground coffee (Optional 2nd Container to store  fine coffee good for using in an espresso maker, Moka pot, etc.)

## The process

For convenience, I have provided a video of the process.

1. Scoop one cup worth of beans using one cup measuring cup

2. Dump into blender container 

3. Switch to manual control starting slow, gradually increasing speed to 80-90% power. The Goal is to have the grounds flutter in a relatively fixed area and not go full tilt and blow the grounds to the lid. It Should take about 10 to 20 seconds depending on how you want the beans ground, start slow and work up until you get a feel or visual for how fast and how long to run the blender to get the intended results.

4. Stop and turn off the blender when the grounds start to flutter in a wavy pattern ~~~~

5. Open the lid and inspect the grounds. The Goal is to not see whole bean pieces, and have the coarseness of ground coffee you want.

6. Carefully Pour the ground coffee into your storage container, the large blender opening can make a mess quick, and the coffee will not pour out as smooth as expected, go slow. All the coffee will not come out without a manual intervention, hence the need for the skewer.

7. Next, remove the grounds stuck in the bottom of the blender, using the skewer run along each side of the blender container and break free the ground coffee stuck, these grounds always end up more finely ground you can separate them into another contain for coffee brewing equipment that requires fine grinds or just mix it in with the prior grind that you aimed for. 

8. Store the fresh ground coffee in an airtight container. 

9. Clean the blender
