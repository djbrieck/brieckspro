Here is a handy implementation of where your bookmark not only marks the pages where you left off at but has three arrows that point to the specific page and paragraph too.

## How To Make one

Here is how you make one using just a standard Index card.

On the blank side of the index card, where there are no horizontal lines, add the following 3 arrow indicators, one in the middle. And the other two at 1/4 and 3/4.

## How to use it this bookmark

When you pause reading

1. Insert the card like you would any standard bookmark in-between the pages near the spine of the book.

2. Position the arrows to point to the page you left off on

3. Slide the card up or down in the book so that one of the three arrow points to the start of paragraph or sentence you paused on.
