While I was at the Apple Store in boise town center getting a new battery installed.  I saw something truly innovative by another customer also in for a genius bar appointment.

The gentleman had an old well-worn Altoids tin that he had pulled from a pocket to pay for service at the Apple Store. I noticed and asked about it.  He said he had been using the tin for over 10 years. I never had a traditional leather wallet last 10 years. And I was needing a new wallet, and had a tin in my backpack still with mints in it. So I gave it a try moving to this new wallet on July 22, 2024.

So far so good cards spare key all fit and rather tightly. I do like the idea and will continue to use it. I just cleaned out this tin and added in all my stuff without any other customization's.

My ID cars, credit cards and more all fit with ease. There is even room for cash.
