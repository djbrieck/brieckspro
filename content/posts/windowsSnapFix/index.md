Trying to stop the next window to resize and position suggestion on Windows 10,11. This is when you snap a window and
then Windows hijacks the UI  asking you now what other windows you would like to fill out the other half the screen 
with. If you're not a fan of that like me, the good news is this is easy to fix. 

## Turn off show what I can snap next to the window just snapped

1. Open Start Menu search for "snap".

2. Select "Snap Settings"

3. Uncheck "When I snap a window, show what I can snap next to it"
