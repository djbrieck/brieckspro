## About Brieck's Pro

This is the personal and professional website of `Daniel Brieck Jr`. This site is about things I want to share publicly.

This website is locally developed and hosted in northeastern Oregon, USA, using IPFS. Check out [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) to help contribute to a decentralized internet. You can help too by installing a browser or plugin that enables IPFS.
