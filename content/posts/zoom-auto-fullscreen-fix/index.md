## The Issue 

Zoom window goes full screen everytime someone shares their screen during a meeting.

I have a very intentional placement of windows on the screen. So I can see my notes etc., so every time
Zoom goes full screen, its bit of a disruption for my workflow.

After a few times, I looked for a way to stop this from happening and found it.
See below for how I stopped the full screen take over with Zoom meetings.

## A Solution 

I have found a fix for that. This should work on Zoom For Desktop on Linux, Windows and possible Mac too.

1. Go to Settings (User Icon if Logged in > Settings)

2. Click "Share Screen" option on the left

# Linux
3. Un-check option of "Enter full screen when a participant shares screen"

# Windows
3. Find the section "Window size when screen sharing":

4. Select the Radio Button option of "Maintain current Size"

# Mac ?
3. Something like above, send me what you find and I will update, do not have access to a current macOS system with Zoom.
