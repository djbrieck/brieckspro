###  Paid Editing $
 I don't have an editor and as a technical developer, grammar and writing is not my strong suite. If you see a problem and would like to help me fix it. Please [create pull request on github](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) and send me the proposed fixes. I will pay a dollar per accepted fix. Payments will be made via Bitcoin Lightning network.
