I have had quite the story on Plus size phones. After being fed up with my last Android phone and my last personal new phone purchase a Google Nexus 6 Plus, which was a giant phone at the time, and seemed like a good price new of $399.99 back in 2015. I was inspired by Apples long term commitment to provide updates and a usable software experience, so I selected a iPhone 6 Plus to buy with the hype, since it was pretty affordable used back in 2018 at around $254. I was immediately impressed back then with how well it was performing especially when compared spec for spec to the newer Nexus 6. Selecting the 6 Plus at this point was a mistake now that I look back on it. When I switched carries later I ended up correcting the mistake anyways by moving to a 6S Plus. Now the 7 Plus a phone I had purchased used for my mom to use. Battery ended up expanding out of the phone and mom needed a new one, I was able to salvage the 7 Plus and get a new battery installed and used that phone for about a year. 

I ran this iPhone 7 Plus until the very last moment for me and now have an idea of exactly how long I can keep an old phone usable for me. While this was an older iPhone in numbers, functionally everything I needed to work worked for me, until it did not on June 15, 2024.

## Reason for needing a new phone

The primary reason was a banking application I use for mobile check deposit stopped working when the app started requiring iOS 16 or later in order to be able to reliably open anymore. There was no other way  to do this deposit, tried mobile website and it did not offer the mobile check deposit option. 

iPhone 7 notes

When it was introduced

when it last OS release was

when it stopped working option for me June 15, 2024

July 7 2024 date I put the iPhone 12 into service.

First off I have been very happy with my iPhone 7 Plus thus far its been a great short run and for only the price of fixing a bulging battery for about $60 it was a great value too. Now I finally and unfortunately reached the point where a mission-critical application is no longer working.

Its one of those cases where it is a banking application and it does work but they are choosing in principle to not work due too so called lack of OS support, which is giving me the mark of needing to be running at least 1 behind current. Anyways app developers do support as far back as you can, since this is the front line on app support and the true indicator for how long a device could be usable to someone.

Was pondering jumping to a iPhone 8 Plus since I could reuse the case I have been using. However pricing on a iPhone 8 Plus 256GB is now around $130. And with only 1 year of support left on it and its max iOS is already at 16 which is the minimal version this banking app needs , I am not seeing it worth the price buying this device for just a few months of support left.

My list of possible options to compare starting the bottom of the support barrel. Going to try to select and guess which one is going to have the lowest cost over its remaining os support life time.

Now if I bought new how much more would I pay?
