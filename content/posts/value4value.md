## What is Value 4 Value

 Value for Value `=`Is a model of voluntarily letting the consumer of content contribute value for the content, based on the value received from the content.

 This value can vary from person to person, and is up to each person to decide what to pay or to not pay. This works really well in the digital world, and maybe could work in the physical world too, however that is a whole different discussion.

## No Agenda Show

This concept of value for value has been coined and put into practice by [John C. Dvorak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_C._Dvorak) and [Adam Curry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Curry) on [The No Agenda Show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Agenda)

I think their [Support & Donation page](http://dvorak.org/na/) says it best in summary.

- Value for Value 

- Next level is titles based on how much is paid. 

For now I want to focus on value for value part, here are some examples from the No Agenda Donation page.

>Unlike any other broadcasts, No Agenda has decided to be a solely listener supported production. This means the listeners contribute to the show both financially and through volunteerism. If you feel you are getting value from this show, please help us by becoming a supporter and passing the word that No Agenda is THE BEST PODCAST IN THE UNIVERSE.
>
>We count on you, to make this work.

> Dollar an Hour is All We Ask.
>
>This is our value for value offering. One dollar for an hour of solid and real information you can use. Plus entertainment more valuable than any movie.

And this model has been working since 2007 for No Agenda.

## Podcasting 2.0

A possible implementation of Value 4 Value for any Podcast. Podcasting 2.0 is driven by progress being made in the [PodcastIndex project](https://podcastindex.org/), and its improves on the original RSS standard for podcasting. Adding many new features one of which is the ability for podcast listeners to include a place to send crypto currency value for value using the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/) directly in the metadata of the podcasts feed in `podcast:value` tag. And with some Podcasting 2.0 compatible 3rd party apps, its now possible to do a few new things. 

1. You can now set things like how much per minute you would like to pay as you listen, which could be zero. 
2. Tip on demand with a button press in your podcasting app, a thing called boosting.

As part of this [value](https://github.com/Podcastindex-org/podcast-namespace/blob/main/value/value.md) specification for podcasting is an ability to split value sent to a podcast, so for example 2 hosts could split the value to the podcast 50/50 or anyway they deem appropriate. Also more recipients can be added as necessary to further split how funds are split. This really enables a lot of flexibility, and once its configured it all happens automatically as the podcast is listened to, if contributing value per minute. The same is true for Boosts.  

## Brave Basic Attention Token

Value for value for the web, well almost. The [Brave Rewards](https://brave.com/brave-rewards/) program is a very interesting concept. I am going to specifically references the implementations of Tipping and Auto Contribute.

## Future of Internet value for value ? 

I think the future of the internet should work more along the lines with what is being tried with Podcasting 2.0. W
