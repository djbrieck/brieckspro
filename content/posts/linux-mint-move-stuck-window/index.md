## Problem

 Moving windows which don't fit on the screen or windows where the grab areas are off the screen can be problematic.

If your screen resolution is too low, or you have a multi-monitor setup that was disconnected you may end up with 
windows that are too small or too large for the screen. And you may be unable to click any interface element on that 
window, thus resulting in a stuck situation.


## Solution

1. When running Linux Mint Cinnamon there is a workaround.

2. Move your mouse cursor anywhere on the window you want to move.

3.  Press <kbd>ALT</kbd> and then  `left-click` with your mouse.
 
4. Now you drag the mouse cursor and window to a location where you can see the window controls, etc.

5. Release the mouse button and the window will be moved to the new location.

6. Release the <kbd>ALT</kbd> key.
