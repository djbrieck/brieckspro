Don't handwrite those repeating bill envelopes nor have to wait for the free return labels to arrive in the junk mail from [AAA](https://www.aaa.com/). Print that right on your envelop using [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/).

1. Open LibreOffice Writer

2. Click on Insert drop down menu choose "Envelope..."

3. Fill in the Addressee and Sender details

4. Click Format tab and under the 'Size' subsection select the envelope size from the Format Drop down.

4. When finished click "New Document" if you just have a envelope to print and you are done customizing options and input.

5. Save you letter template so you can reuse for paying bills, etc.

6. Now Print, this may take some trial and error to get the orientation correct so that it prints the correct way for mailing.
