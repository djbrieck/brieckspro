I have been pretty frustrated with lack of information on local business. I think this is possibly due to the excessive costs and fees sometimes associated with running a website, not including the complications of managing and running a custom domain name. Most places just don't bother to take the time and effort to maintain a website and domain.

Many places unfortunately use Facebook's free business pages or other free things like Google etc. Facebook has its own issues but mainly it seems to be inconsistent and can sometimes require a login before you can view basic information on a business. Also it may require you to use the Facebook smartphone app and may otherwise make it difficult to find what your looking for. Most commonly I am looking for business hours, a menu, address, phone number and other basic information and often Facebook makes that a challenge and excessively frustrating. For example searching through photos or posts for menus is something that is often necessary for most businesses.

So I am taking it into my own hands to build dirt simple free websites that are hosted on IPFS or wherever and therefore do not need tradition domain name fees. These are pure content and require minimal effort to maintain and update. About 3 hours of work to make each site. Since I would rather see a basic website than nothing at all for most places I would like to do business with. Feel free to follow this guide and do the same in your local area. So instead of searching each time  gather and create something useful for yourself and others to use as well.
