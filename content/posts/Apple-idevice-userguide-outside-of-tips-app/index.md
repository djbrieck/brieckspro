If you use Apple devices like iPhone, iPad, or Watch, I highly recommend checking out their User Guides. I hadn't looked at these until I picked up a used iPhone 12 Pro in (2024) running the current iOS version at the time after last using iOS 15 older hardware.

The iPhone user guide is mentioned in the [Apple Tips](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tips/id1069509450) app, but you can also view it on any computer by visiting [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/) and finding the User Guide for your Apple products. This information is usually at the bottom of the product support page and can be hard to find quickly.

Most user guides let you select the version of iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, tvOS, macOS, etc., that you are using. This is helpful if you are running an older OS version and want to know what features are available.

You might discover features or tips you didn't know about. I found a few new things after reading the iPhone User Guide for the first time.
