Learned something new you can connect to Wi-Fi using a QR code, this QR code is easily accessible in Android for sharing, but a bit of a challenge on iPhone / iPad, but can  be accomplished just the same.

[Sharing and connecting with QR code on Android](https://odysee.com/@ion:d/how-to-share-wifi-password-with-qr-code:c)

This is possible on Apple Stuff as well but is regrettably hidden and not intuitive to find.

The good news is that this work cross platform its rather easy to get a Wifi share QR created. And I was able to observe it working from Android to iPad. So my questions was can you generate a QR from that iPhone or iPad to be able to share to someone else.

And the answer is yes you can but its a many more than one step process.

To complete this you will need the Apple  Shortcuts app installed.

1. Open the Shortcuts App

2.  Find and touch the "Gallery" icon

3. Find and touch the Shortcuts for Accessibility

4. Look through the Access Tools and find the "QR Your Wi-Fi" shortcut.

5. Then touch the "+ Add Shortcut" button

6. Tap the shortcuts button at the bottom, then tap "All Shortcuts" at the top.

7. Tap "QR your Wi-Fi"

8. Enter WiFi name it should show by default the one you are connected to.

9. Enter the WiFi password

10 QR code is generated and displayed on the screen.

11. Tap the QR code and share or save the code as such to be able to reuse.
