My goal was to have a reference that shows every iPhone since the iPhone 6 in a table that shows historical track record all in one place to allow an easy comparison.

This information may be used to indicate when software support could end for a current iPhone model in the future. As with this and investing, historical performance may not indicate what will happen in the future, but as it stands now the track record has been very consistent. Current support ends six years after it was first released.
