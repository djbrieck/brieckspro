Home app opened and was asking a question I did not want to answer at the time about notification preferences on how I wanted to be alerted in this app.

Pressed the lock button, to try to dismiss the alert I did not want to answer on the phone since I was helping some else set up a new phone.

Upon pressing the power button to attempt to unlock the phone again, I see the alert is still showing.
And it's over the lock screen, and they Don't Allow and Allow buttons are the only thing that responds,
however, they do nothing when press but highlight.
Nice bug Apple.

I press the Power and volume down button to try and power off the phone like an "home button less "iPad would be turned off. Since this is an Apple phone should be consistent. Not going to power off by just holding the power button like the old iPhones with a home button.

The power slider shows up, but it too is not responding or touchable.

Then, as a last resort, I try to force power off the device by pressing and holding the power and vol down button. And then I hear an odd chime noise. I keep holding, think its doing a new warning for powering off, no its getting ready to call 911 and does, had no indication it was going to do that since it was stuck behind an unresponsive dialog.

Absolutely terrible default implementation and more  buggy Apple software and why must Apple must mess with how you power off a device, just make no sense to me.

And how you force power off this device makes no intuitive sense coming from prior iPhones and computers.  https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/force-restart-iphone-iph8903c3ee6/ios
