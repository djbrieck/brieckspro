## Experiments  

### The single serving attempt
Tried a brief experiment using my standard 1 mug (12-14oz) filled with water and one scope or about 2 teaspoons of coffee in the instant pot (pressure cooker). Single serving just to see how well this does compared to how I usually make a single serving of coffee which is [Filtered - Cowboy process]()

Set a four-minute cooking time on high pressure. 

Slow natural release took 30 minutes. Yikes!!! 

The results where really good 



Next experiment 1 liter thermos with 2 scopes of grounds or about (4 teaspoons)

Natural release took 46 - 53 minutes

Need to check the output temperature hopefully its at least 160 degrees farenheight. Was around 173 after the natural release.

After the natural release I ran the results though the coffee stand filter right into the mug / insulated thermos for  storage.

Was very strong in flavor using same amounts as done in my improved cowboy process.
