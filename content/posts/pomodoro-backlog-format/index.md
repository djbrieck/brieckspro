Here is the backlog format that I have been using with
[my take of the Pomodoro inspired work log format]({{< ref "posts/pomodoro">}})

In a file like this is where you can put things that you are unable to get done today,
but need to get done at some point in the future.
 
Each project gets a section with some kind of decorator surrounding the project.
For example, I choose three `+`  which will look something like so `+++  Project +++`

Task/s for each project is listed under the project.
Ideally, you can place the most important thing to work on next at the top of the list,
but you can arrange and order as you wish. 

Here is an example of what the format looks like

    +++ Project 1 +++
    Project 1 Task 1
    
    Project 1 Task 2

    Project 1 Task ...

    
    +++ Project 2 +++
    Project 2 Task 1
    
    Project 2 Task 2

    Project 2 Task ...


    +++ Project 3 +++
    Project 3 Task 1

    Project 3 Task 2

    Project 3 Task ...
