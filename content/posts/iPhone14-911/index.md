The Home app or some other initial setup component was prompted by a notification pop up asking to set preferences on how I wanted to be alerted in this app.
Thinking this was like phone setup I I
thought I could just lock the screen to get out of it and sort of re-start the setup later was my intention. 

So I pressed the power button,
to try to dismiss the alert I did not want to answer on the phone since I was helping some else set up a new phone.

Upon pressing the power button to attempt to unlock the phone again, I see the alert is still showing.
And it's over the lock screen, and the Don't Allow and Allow buttons are the only thing that responds,
however, they do nothing when press but highlight.
Nice bug Apple.

I press the Power
and volume down button to try and power off the phone like a "home button less "iPad would be turned off.
Since this is an Apple phone should be consistent.
Not going to power off by just holding the power button like the old iPhones with a home button.

The power slider shows up, but it too is not responding or touchable.

Then, as a last resort, I try to force power off the device by pressing and holding the power and vol down button.
And then I hear an odd chime noise.
I keep holding, think its doing a new warning for powering off, no it's just calling 911.
I had no indication it was going to do that since it was stuck behind an unresponsive dialog.
Luckily, I was able to confirm with 911 that this was an accidental call and that help was not needed. 

Pretty neat that button press commonly used for power off the device is also very close to what
has been added for calling 911 in an emergency.

Absolutely terrible default implementation and more buggy Apple software and why must Apple must mess
with how you power off a device,
just make no sense to me. 

## How to force to restart an iPhone

Take a look at [how to restart a iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/force-restart-iphone-iph8903c3ee6/ios) and notice this button pressing scheme makes no intuitive sense coming from prior iPhones, Android Phones, iPads and even computers with an ATX power scheme have worked since 1995.  

## How to call for help on a iPhone

With that being said the most import part is understanding how dialing 911 works on iPhones, since I had no idea how this all works.
