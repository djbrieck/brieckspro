## About Brieck's Pro

This is the personal and professional website of `Daniel Brieck Jr` This site is about things that I would like to talk about that's on my mind and needs to be written down and shared publicly.

This website is locally developed and hosted in northeastern Oregon,
USA in Union County (Or where ever I happen to be working at) using IPFS.
Checkout [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) to help contribute to a decentralized internet. You can help too,
install a browser or plugin that enables IPFS in your existing browser if you have not done so already.
