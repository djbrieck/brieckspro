We always want to have a miracle we can see that proves that God exists. This mention in the bible, and if you seek this nothing will be provided as proof for you.

I was in a low state at work and need help was at my whits end stuck on a problem. I prayed about it and the next day. 
It all came together and was resolved. 

That was really proof for me that God exists.

In the past I relegated prayer to something done once a day at bedtime. Doing something like the Lord's Prayer. Now I provide God the exact words of the prayer since that is what is needed in any relationship, and no one can help you if you don't ask for help.
