## Problem 

Eggs stick to the skillet like they were glued in, and now you loose food and time scraping out the wasted food.

Cooking with Stainless steel requires a certain level of process to work successfully, I was doing the completely wrong process for this type of skillet, I was able to cook with stainless in the past but just recently after tossing out the nonstick skillet I could not get eggs to fry without sticking like glue to the pan.

## A solution that works for eggs not sticking on stainless steel cookware.

1. Place the stainless steel pan on the stove, set heat to 50% power or medium.

2. Allow the pan to get fully heated may take 5-10 minutes.

3. While skillet is heating prepare your food / eggs by cracking open and placing in a bowl

4. Next sprinkle some water in the skillet and watch what happens to the water.

   - Water sticks immediately and evaporates on contact => `Too hot lower the power some`

   - Water just lays still and takes a while to evaporate. => `Allow skillet to warm up longer or increase the power some more if your stuck here` 
   - **Water hits the skillet and scatters like glass shattering and scatters into many small beads that flow over the skillets hot  surface. => `Temperature is where it needs to be don't adjust anymore leave skillet on burner this is where the skillet temperature needs to be before moving forward`**

5. Add oil this is required. Use Butter or oil, and fully coat the bottom of the pan and sides some as needed, if using butter notice how it glides quickly around the pan.

6. Then immediately pour in your eggs to allow cooking and reduce smoke from the oils potentially overheating. The skillet is hot and cooks the eggs fast so pay attention to not overcook.

7. Do not adjust up or down the temperature.

8. After the eggs full cook on one side the eggs should self release from the skillet. With this process you can expect non-stick skillet performance or better, careful the food may slide right out of the skillet its so slippery using this process.

9. If cooking more eggs re-start at step 3.

10. Otherwise, turn off stove burner and let the skillet cool.

11. Enjoy easy clean up of the skillet later after it has cooled down.

This process helped me turn cooking with stainless from a chore to a joy.
