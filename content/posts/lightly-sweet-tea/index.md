A recipe for sweet tea with a simple common sense approach of just adding less real 
sweetener. No need to substitute some kind of sugar-free to try and trick your mind.

## My Tea ratio for Luzianne Tea Quart Tea Bags

    1 Tablespoon of Sugar per quart of ice tea brewed

Now that's how I do lite. Add as little as you can tolerate but here is what I found to be 
sweet enough for me. The problem with most sweet teas is that there is just too much 
sugar. Since its sugar, and it's addicting it natural to want to add to much, but it gets
to be a point where all you taste is the sugar, and loose the flavor of the actual tea.

# Finding your ratio for the perfect Lite Tea

My suggestion is simply adding less and less sugar each time you brew. Start with what 
you normally do. And cut back by half each time, until you find the perfect mix. The 
standard recipe from the Luzianne box called for 1/4 cup of sugar per Quart of Ice Tea. 
I changed this with experimentation and found the perfect level of sweetness for the 
Luzianne tea I brew to be the one indicated above. Also, if your tea lacks a good flavor 
now with less sugar try a different brand, Lipton and Walmart store brand teas tend to lack 
flavor and in my opinion taste quite bad without the high sugar cover. I have found the 
Luzianne to have a decent flavor for an affordable commercially available tea. Highly 
recommend Luzianne Tea if your local stores carry it.
