Trying to stop the next window to resize and position suggestion on windows 10, this is where you snap a window and then Windows hijacks your UI asking you to fill out the other half with other windows. If your not a fan of that like me, where I just want the window snapped and be back to my work, read on for a fix. 

Good news is this is easy to fix. 

Open Start Menu search for "snap".

Select "Snap Settings"

Uncheck "When I snap a window, show what I can snap next to it"
