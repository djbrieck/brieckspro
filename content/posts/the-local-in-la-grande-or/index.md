On  the main entrances side is Ice Cream and drinks. These are the doors on Adams and ........

In the back past glass door ice-cream freezers is the separate counter where the food orders are placed.

Food is good had the all day breakfast sandwich, included chips, price was pretty steep at nearly $13.50 for a egg breakfast sandwich. in May 2025.

Drip Coffee is good but border line too hot, let it cool down some to enjoy the flavor more.

Ice Cream is good its better than soft serve, but I still prefer the [Extra Creamy Tillamook](https://www.tillamook.com/products/ice-cream/all) Ice cream over this. At 4.50 a scoop is very expensive and just pretty good.

The local is what I call City Hard, there are only a small hand full of comfortable places to sit,  Small couch, and chair. And maybe two more padded chairs in the food place around the back. most places are hard chairs, benches or stools, which is conductive to a place that does not want you sticking around there too long, which is opposite to the name of the place hinting that this is a place for locals to hangout.
