Grilling top sirloin on a Weber gas grill is a great way to get a flavorful, juicy steak with a nice sear. Here’s a simple approach to grilling it

## **Steps for Grilling Top Sirloin on a Weber Gas Grill**

1. **Preheat the Grill** – Set your Weber gas grill to **high heat** (around 450-500°F) and let it preheat for about **10-15 minutes**.
2. **Prepare the Steak** – Take the top sirloin out of the fridge **30 minutes before grilling** to let it come to room temperature.
3. **Seasoning** – Keep it simple with **kosher salt and black pepper**, or use a marinade like **olive oil, balsamic vinegar, garlic, and rosemary**.
4. **Oil the Grates** – Lightly oil the grill grates to prevent sticking.
5. **Grill the Steak** – Place the steak on the hot grill and **close the lid**. Cook for about:
    - **4-6 minutes per side** for medium-rare (135°F internal temp).
    - **6-8 minutes per side** for medium (145°F internal temp).
6. **Rest the Steak** – Remove from the grill and let it rest for **5-10 minutes** before slicing to allow the juices to redistribute.
