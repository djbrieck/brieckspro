# Introduction

If your faced with a laptop that has a bios password preventing anything from occurring on that laptop, here is a fix that worked for a 2007 era vintage Dell Inspiron 1720.

This machine had been sitting with no use for years, upon trying to get the system to boot from another disk it prompted for a password and the system refused to even boot.

I tried many things even doing all the following as suggest by [Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/shares/dTYp5doDRkxF9YaLVmhSi) and several other internet searches. 

Stuff thats not worth trying that did not work:

I finally found the fix  after doing a new searching something like "Clear BIOS password" which lead me to discover the [Clear unknown BIOS passwords](https://bios-pw.org/). 




1. When stuck at bios password screen

2. I found https://bios-pw.org/

3. Entered the computer info name as "3TH2ZD1-595b"

4. Pressed get password button

5. I used one of the codes suggested as "Try one of the following codes:"

The one listed next to Dell from serial number worked for this laptop.
