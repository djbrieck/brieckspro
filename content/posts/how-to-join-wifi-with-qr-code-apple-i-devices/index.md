This was a mystery to many myself included, but I say it is possible to connect to Wi-Fi using a QR code. Its not well advertised by Apple. And  most of the time [Apples built in magical automatic Wi-Fi password sharing works as follows](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/102635). That in short is where you try to connect to Wi-Fi and then someone near you can click a prompt and share the password to you. Sometimes this does not work and in those cases here is the QR option, that always works no Apple hidden magic needed.

There are at least two ways to connect to Wi-Fi using a Wi-Fi QR Code on most iPhones and iPads that I have discovered thus far:

## Using the Camera App

1. Open the Camera App

2. Point camera at QR code for Wi-Fi

3. Click the Link that shows up

4. Click Join the wifi network


## Using the Scan QR Code Control Center widget.

You may need to add the Scan QR widget if one is not present see [Customize  Control Center](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/use-and-customize-control-center-iph59095ec58/ios)

1. Open [Control Center](https://support.apple.com/en-us/108330)

2. Tap the Scan QR Code icon

3. Point camera at the wifi QR code

4. Click "Join" to connect to the network as advertised.
