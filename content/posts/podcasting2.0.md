## Podcasting 2.0

A possible implementation of Value 4 Value for any Podcast. Podcasting 2.0 is driven by progress being made in the [PodcastIndex project](https://podcastindex.org/), and its improves on the original RSS standard for podcasting. Adding many new features one of which is the ability for podcast listeners to include a place to send crypto currency value for value using the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/) directly in the metadata of the podcasts feed in `podcast:value` tag. And with some Podcasting 2.0 compatible 3rd party apps, its now possible to do a few new things. 

1. You can now set things like how much per minute you would like to pay as you listen, which could be zero. 
2. Tip on demand with a button press in your podcasting app, a thing called boosting.
3. Send a message and a boot to the podcast, bootogram

As part of this [value](https://github.com/Podcastindex-org/podcast-namespace/blob/main/value/value.md) specification for podcasting is an ability to split value sent to a podcast, so for example 2 hosts could split the value to the podcast 50/50 or anyway they deem appropriate. Also more recipients can be added as necessary to further split how funds are split. This really enables a lot of flexibility, and once its configured it all happens automatically as the podcast is listened to, when the user chooses to contribute value. The same is true for Boosts, etc.
