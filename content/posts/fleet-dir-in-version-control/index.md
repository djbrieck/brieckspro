I recently noticed I have a new directory named `.fleet` modified in a recent development project, that I had 
accidentally checked in. Should this be checked into version control with your project?

This .fleet is what is generated by the new Code Editor / IDE [JetBrains Fleet](https://www.jetbrains.com/fleet/).

It depends on your project team, or your personal preferences. If everyone is required to use the same editor with the 
same configuration for the project. Then yes, it should be checked in. 

For me and the teams I work with, everyone uses different tools.  So the answer leans toward No, and you should not 
check in the `.fleet` directory with your project's code, since it's your settings for your choice of ide in this case.

If you don't want it checked in, be sure to add a line like .fleet/ to your `.gitignore` version control exclusions 
files, so you will not have to manage it in version control changes.
