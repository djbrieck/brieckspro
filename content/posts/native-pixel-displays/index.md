Coining my own set of terms since I can. Here it is it's called "Native Pixel Displays". This is effectively any 
computer display that is usable without the use of scaling or other forms of software magnification to be able to read 
the screen.

## This historical standard

This is how computer displays have generally worked since the beginning of computing. 
[CRTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode-ray_tube) had some level of resolution changing, but generally speaking, 
there were only a handful of usable resolutions where the display worked best with low flicker, etc. Most CRT displays 
did not require any form of resolution scaling unlike today, what was on the screen was all you could see, and it had 
to be usable as is since that's all there was.

## The size up

After that point, the screens got progressively larger over time and started having larger screen real estate and more 
pixels as well.

Eg I remember staring at resolutions something like the following since 1994:
    280 x 192
    512 x 342 <--- Far past mid to late 1990s era 
    640 x 480 
    800 x 600
    1024 X 768
    1280 X 800
    1440 X 900 
    1920 X 1080
    1900 X 1200
    2560 X 1440
    2560 X 1600  <--- More recent past

## The peak

As a software developer during the past years since working in the software industry since 2008, I have been exposed to 
some of the best computer hardware in the industry. One such thing that I would like to comment on is the 27" to 30" 
2K resolution display. This was the high-end dare I say gold-standard of display standards that started back in 2004 
with the introduction of the Apple Cinema Display 30" and other "nice" displays like the Dell UltraSharp 3007WFP and 
others of similar caliber. These displays featured a 2560 x 1600 max native resolution. Which is still quite good and 
usable as far as a native non-scaled resolution goes on a 27" to 30" computer screen. In fact, this is what I prefer 
using in 2024 granted the 2560 X 1440 variant. This level of resolution, generally speaking, was 
and has been one of the largest pieces of Screen real estate you could buy, since it's been introduced

## The biggest innovation since 2004 has been adding more pixel density, while maintaining the same or very similar working area

How have we innovated since 2004, we added more pixels density, while maintaining a similar viewing area about the same 
as this old 2K display standard. For example, a modern 4K computer monitor in the 27" to 30" range, must use image scaling to scale up 
the size of everything on the screen otherwise details are too small to be practical.
